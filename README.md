# 5.2_PHPDropdowns_i308
Your team task is to create a web-based front end that provides information about a Band in an attractive format.

# Step 0: Run the Assignment52.sql 
Download Assignment52.sqlscript to make sure you are starting with the correct set of tables (p_Band, p_Artist, etc.). (0 points)

# Step 1: Create the bandselect.php file (20 points)
The page should contain a drop-down list that is populated dynamically from the p_Band table. The list should show only the band title and should be ordered by title. Only the band's id should be passed to bandinfo.php.

Your bandselect.php should run a script that calls bandinfo.php to display the current data about the selected band.

# Step 2: Create bandinfo.php (30 points)
This page must display the information about the selected band. This should include the year formed, the names of the members, the albums the band has released, and the year each album was released. Within reason, it is up to you what you include and how you display it, but points will be given based on how well you demonstrate your skills in PHP and HTML to produce an attractive and informative website.
